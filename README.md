Learn languages more effectively! 

Generate a random text in the language you want to learn, and upload yourself speaking that language. Get effective feedback from native speakers that let you know the right pronunciations and intonations. 

The best way to learn a language is to have conversations with real speakers giving real feedback.

Using the webapp
1. Browse through forums of users uploading their speech and native speakers advising on the front page
2. Create a post with the + button
3. Select language, generate a speech with the random generator, and record yourself speaking
4. Upload the audio file, and let native speakers listen to you
5. Comments will be shown under your post to help you achieve your language learning goals.
